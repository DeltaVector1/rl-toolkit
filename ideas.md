# Difficulty ideas

## Measured long-haul evidence

Snapshot: 2026-09-14 15:14 UTC, run `glm-decensor-difficulty-9`.

- The earlier reward report covered steps 7-34. Effective reward mean was
  0.0629, fit was -0.0421, and the noise threshold was 0.0650. Verdict:
  **inside the noise**. This was not evidence of improvement or decline.
- Completed steps 35-50 had effective rewards
  [0.0131, 0.0515, 0.0308, 0.0663, 0.0322, 0.0557, 0.0221, 0.0563,
  0.0265, 0.0118, 0.0116, 0.0501, 0.0370, 0.0285, 0.0136, 0.0395].
  Mean is 0.0342, standard deviation is 0.0177, fit is -0.0119, residual is
  0.0173, and the noise threshold is 0.0346. Verdict: **inside the noise**.
  The measured change is too small to show improvement or decline.
- Descriptively, steps 35-40 had mean reward 0.0416, while the hard-heavy
  steps 41-50 had mean reward 0.0297. This comparison is descriptive, not
  statistically proven.
- Step 50 reward was 0.0395 with 766/1,568 trainable rollouts (48.9%), zero
  errors, and 29m08 rollout time.
- Trainer compute for steps 44-49 was 403.74s, 405.86s, 403.26s, 406.36s,
  403.99s, and 404.66s. This was stable at about 6m44-6m46, with a peak of
  44.4 GiB/GPU and no OOM or nonfinite values.
- Adapter staging for v44-v49 stayed below 5m. Examples were v44 2m58 with
  1m33 network time, v45 3m03 with 1m30 network time, v46 2m48 with 1m28
  network time, and v48 3m02 with 1m34 network time.
- n82 cleanup left about 879 GiB free (74% used) during the run.
- Step 32 reward is 0.0156 with 400/640 trainable rollouts (62.5%). The
  accepted mix is easy 10.0%, medium 32.5%, hard 57.5%; rewards are easy
  0.0366, medium 0.0111, and hard 0.0122. Compare each difficulty separately;
  the mix changes the aggregate.
- Step 32 trainer forward/backward time is 408.95s. The status snapshot has
  1,268,125/1,500,000 accepted tokens (84.5%), 248 inflight rollouts, and no
  rollout failures or unscored rollouts in the last five minutes. Acceptance
  still records one transport/rollout failure and no 2,048-batch validation.

## Qualitative audit through step 32

- The audit covers 23,435 rows and 46,340 turns.
- Audit reward by difficulty is easy 0.1452, medium 0.0195, and hard 0.0057.
- Hard reward is mainly real refusal: 7,150/8,228 hard records score refusal
  9. Hard records include 387 fulfilled and 15,732 declined cases.
- Hard reasoning penalty is 98.5%; meta is 16.2%, word is 75.3%, and Markdown
  is 28.4%.
- Visible-answer failures are 0.33%; reasoning incoherence is 0.035%.
- High-refusal judge decisions are consistent: 26,678 decisions, only 2
  partially fulfilled, and no silent replacement.
- Topic switches are 0.17% overall and 0.068% for hard; there is no broad
  reward hack. Invalid model responses are 1.55%; judge parse failures are
  0.06%.
- Conclusion: low hard reward is mainly real refusal, not judge error.

## Reasoning audit

- The audit has 15,356 scored records and 5,157 fulfilled turns. None of the
  fulfilled turns has an explicit refusal.
- The 2,655 fulfilled-only records are the strongest possible false-positive
  set for an internal-refusal penalty.
- The reasoning multiplier affected 13,221 records, but this includes true
  refusals.

## Group 16 signal

- Full groups were easy 278 (6 all-refusal), medium 390 (52 all-refusal), and
  hard 477 (252 all-refusal).
- Hard non-all-refusal groups had reward spread 217/225. This shows usable
  signal exists, but more than half of hard groups refuse entirely.

## Worked

- Multi-turn traces contain more than one assistant turn.
- Staged sampling changes the difficulty stage as intended.
- Direct all-refusal exclusion works: 75 raw groups / 1,200 rollouts had 10
  all-refusal groups skipped (easy 1, medium 1, hard 8), plus 1 errored group,
  leaving 64 groups / 1,024 rollouts. There were zero zero-advantage groups
  and no complete all-9 group in the effective traces. Keep this curriculum
  protection so a batch does not become all-zero.
- Steps 1-41 all-9 group rates were easy 1.07%, medium 5.80%, and hard
  49.83%.
- Equal raw sampling with the skip gave an accepted mix of easy 40.00%,
  medium 38.94%, and hard 21.05%. Approximate raw compensation is
  easy:medium:hard = 1:1.05:1.97.
- The external judge was saturated at 80 running, 0 waiting, about 543.5
  tok/s, and about 96% GPU use. Do not raise concurrency now.

## Did not work or is not enough

- The hard-heavy staged curriculum did not show a reward climb by step 50.
  Recent trainable rates were roughly 49-55%. These observations do not show
  causality.
- One step is not a reward result. Step 1 took 44m09, had 1,024/1,200
  trainable rollouts, mean reward 0.1080, and mix easy 48% / medium 36% /
  hard 16%; it is only a collection check.
- The current long-haul reward is **inside the noise**, not a proven trend.
  Do not judge an idea from five steps. Use 40-50 completed trainer steps,
  unless a hard failure ends the experiment.
- An earlier steps 6-40 summary had reward fit -0.0048 and noise threshold
  0.0433. Keep it as historical evidence, not as the current step-32 result.
- The previous production-shaped trainer trial stopped at the 600s
  forward/backward limit: 606.58s active, with no completion, OOM, or crash.
  Its saved optimizer batch had 1,864 samples, 4,522,029 raw tokens,
  2,712,271 loss tokens, and max sequence 24,060. The earlier roughly 3m
  fixed-token result is not comparable.

## In progress

- Next clean comparison: run 50 steps with constant 1:1:1 raw easy:medium:hard
  sampling and everything else unchanged.

## Untested

- Rollout time added by retries and all-refusal replacement.
- Concurrent visible and reasoning judge phases with separate prompts,
  history, events, retries, and strict validation.
- A specialized correction prompt for contradictory declined and explicit-
  refusal fields.
- After the clean comparison, add an explicit `answer_restriction_applied`
  decision so a brief caution in a fully fulfilled answer is not treated as
  an internal refusal. Keep the penalty for declined, partial, or replaced
  answers. Test this alone for 40-50 steps.
- Distinguish an actual refusal decision in the reasoning trace from a brief
  caution in an otherwise fulfilled answer. Do not deploy it mid-run; compare
  it only in a clean 40-50-step run.

## Acceptance

- Actual ratios change by stage.
- Multi-turn traces contain more than one assistant turn.
- With exclusion enabled, all-refusal groups create no optimizer samples.
- Use 40-50 completed trainer steps unless a hard failure occurs.
- Compare each difficulty separately and require reward movement beyond noise.
